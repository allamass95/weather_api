## Weather Analysis

Created Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Built a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
